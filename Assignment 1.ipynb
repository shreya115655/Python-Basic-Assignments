    "1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.\n",
    "* \n",
    "Ans:'hello': Value\n",
    "-87.8 : Value\n",
    "- : Expression\n",
    "/ : Expression\n",
    "+ : Expression\n",
    "6 : Value\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:String: String is a sequence which is made of characters & is denoted by ''or \"\". Example: \"Hello\".\n",
    "Variable: Variable is a name that is used to refer to a memory location. Python variable is also known as an identifier and it is used to hold value. Variable can hold integer, string etc. equal (=) operator is used to assign value to a variable.\n",
    "Example: a=50, here a is the variable name.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Describe three different data types.\n",
    "Ans:-> Numeric: int, float, complex: Numeric data type is used to hold numeric values like \n",
    "int - holds signed integers of non-limited length. example : 2, 3 ,24 etc\n",
    "float- holds floating precision numbers, example : 15.23\n",
    "complex- holds complex numbers, example : 2+3i\n",
    "\n",
    "->String: String is a sequence of characters, strings are represented by single or double quotes.example: \"hello\"\n",
    "\n",
    "->Sequence: list, tuple\n",
    "list is a datatype which can hold various types of data, lists are mutable & is represented by square brackets and commas.example:list1=[\"hello\",1,2,3,\"world\"]\n",
    "The tuple is another data type which is a sequence of data similar to a list. But it is immutable.Tuple is is represented by parenthesis and commas.example:tuple1=(\"hello\", 1,2,3,\"world\")\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "Ans:A combination of operands and operators is called an expression. The expression in Python produces some value or result after being interpreted by the Python interpreter. \n",
    "example:\n",
    "x=x+10. In this expression,first 10 is added to the variable x. After the addition is performed, the result is assigned to the variable x.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:A statement in Python is used for creating variables or for displaying values.The expression in Python produces some value or result after being interpreted by the Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "A statement in Python is not evaluated for some results.An expression in Python is evaluated for some results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of statement : x=10.\n",
    "Output 10\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of statement : x=20+10.\n",
    "Output 30\n",
    "\n",
    "6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?\n",
    "bacon = 22\n",
    "bacon + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:22\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What should the values of the following two terms be?\n",
    "'spam' + 'spamspam'\n",
    "'spam' * 3\n",
    "Ans: For both the cases output will be 'spamspamspam'\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    "Ans: Because variable names cannot begin with a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "For string str() \n",
    "For integer int()\n",
    "For floating point no float()\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?\n",
    "'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'\n",
    "Ans:This expression causes and error because in this line 'I have eaten' and 'burritos' are strings, while 99 is an integer. In order to fix the error and print 'I have eaten 99 burritos.', 99 needs '' around it to treat it as a string . \n",
    "So, the corrected one will be :'I have eaten ' + '99' + ' burritos.'--> 'I have eaten 99 burritos.'\n",
